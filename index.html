	<p class="center">MANIFESTO 1<br>The Blockchain Manifesto</p>

    <br>

    <p class="center">INTRODUCTION</p>

	<p>The Blockchain is becoming an increasingly important part of our lives. The Internet of Value Blockchain
		Alliance for Good project is a global community of people who believe that openness, innovation, and
		opportunity are key to the continued health of the Blockchain. We have worked together since 2016 to ensure
		that the Blockchain is developed in a way that benefits everyone.</p>

	<p>The Blockchain Alliance For Good project uses a community-based approach to create world-class open source
		software and to develop new types of collaborative activities. We create communities of people involved in
		making the Blockchain experience better for all of us.</p>

	<p>As a result of these efforts, we have distilled a set of principles that we believe are critical for the
		Blockchain to continue to benefit the public good as well as commercial aspects of life. We set out these
		principles below.</p>

	<p>The goals for the Manifesto are to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>- articulate a vision for the Blockchain that Alliance participants want the Blockchain Alliance For Good
			to pursue;</li>
		<li>- speak to people whether or not they have a technical background;</li>
		<li>- make Alliance contributors proud of what we’re doing and motivate us to continue;</li>
		<li>- and provide a framework for other people to advance this vision of the Blockchain.</li>
	</ul>

    <p>These principles will not come to life on their own. People are needed to make the Blockchain open and
		participatory - people acting as individuals, working together in groups, and leading others. The Blockchain
		Alliance For Good is committed to advancing the principles set out in the Alliance’s Manifesto. We invite
		others to join us and make the Blockchain an ever better place for everyone.</p>

	<br>

	<p class="center">PRINCIPLES</p>

	<ul>
		<li>- The Blockchain is an integral part of modern life - a key component in education, communication,
			collaboration, business, entertainment and society as a whole.</li>
		<li>- The Blockchain is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible.</li>
		<li>- The Blockchain must enrich the lives of individual human beings</li>
		<li>- Individuals’ security and privacy on the Blockchain are fundamental and must not be treated as
			optional.</li>
		<li>- Individuals must have the ability to shape the Blockchain and their own experiences on it.</li>
		<li>- The effectiveness of the Blockchain as a public resource depends upon interoperability (protocols, data
			formats, content), innovation and decentralized participation worldwide.</li>
		<li>- Free and open source software promotes the development of the Blockchain as a public resource.</li>
		<li>- Transparent community-based processes promote participation, accountability and trust.<li>
		<li>- Commercial involvement in the development of the Blockchain brings many benefits; a balance between
		commercial profit and public benefit is critical.</li>
		<li>- Magnifying the public benefit aspects of the Blockchain is an important goal, worthy of time, attention
			and commitment.</li>
	</ul>

	<br>

	<p class="center">ADVANCING THE BLOCKCHAIN MANIFESTO</p>

	<p>There are many different ways of advancing the principles of the Alliance’s Manifesto. We welcome a broad
		range of activities, and anticipate the same creativity that Alliance participants have shown in other areas
		of the project. For individuals not deeply involved in the Blockchain Alliance For Good project, one basic
		and very effective way to support the Manifesto is to use Seratio metrics and other products that embody the
		principles of the Manifesto.</p>

	<br>

	<p class="center">THE BLOCKCHAIN ALLIANCE FOR GOOD PLEDGE</p>

	<p>The Blockchain Alliance For Good pledges to support the Alliance’s Manifesto in its activities. Specifically,
		we will:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>- build and enable open-source technologies and communities that support the Manifesto’s principles;</li>
		<li>- build and deliver great consumer products that support the Manifesto’s principles;</li>
		<li>- use the Alliance assets (intellectual property such as copyrights and trademarks, infrastructure, funds,
			and reputation) to keep the Blockchain an open platform;</li>
		<li>- promote models for creating economic value for the public benefit;</li>
		<li>- and promote the Alliance’s Manifesto principles in public discourse and within the Blockchain industry
			.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Some Alliance activities—currently the creation, delivery and promotion of consumer products are conducted
		primarily through the <a href="https://www.cceg.org.uk/">Centre for Citizenship, Enterprise and Governance</a>
		wholly owned subsidiary, the CCEG
		Blockchain UN Lab.</p>

	<p>As also happened in the early internet days, the lack of skilled blockchain developers is also a major concern
		of the Alliance and is currently being addressed by strategic partnerships with educational institutions.</p>

	<br>

	<p class="center">INVITATION</p>

	<p>The Blockchain Alliance For Good invites all others who support the principles of the Alliance’s Manifesto to
		join with us, and to find new ways to make this vision of the Blockchain a reality.
